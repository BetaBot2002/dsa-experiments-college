### Experiment-I: 
Read data from FILE into an array. Write an implementation of
bubble sort that can be used to sort the array. Use library function qsort to sort
the array on i) rollNumber ii) name and iii) total of marks and save them in separate
output files. Compare performance between your bubble sort implementation and
qsort.

### Experiment-2:
Implement an AVL tree using pointers. Read data from File into
your AVL tree, generating a "verbose" of steps during inserting each student data
in the tree. Generate output files for pre-, in- and post-order traversal of your
tree.

### Experiment-3:
Repeat Experiment-2 but with a Heap implemented using an array.

### Experiment-4:
Demonstrate the efficacy of a stack in solving a) postfix expression
evaluation and b) Stock Span problems. Prepare you own input files to prove the
correctness of your programs. There should be output files tracing the different
parts of your implementation at different debug levels.

### Experiment-5:
Demonstrate the efficacy of Prim's and Kruskal's minimal spanning
tree algorithms. Prepare you own input files to prove the correctness of your
programs. There should be output files tracing the different parts of your
implementation at different debug levels.
### Experiment-6:
Demonstrate the efficacy of Dijkstra's minimum path algorithm.
Prepare you own input files to prove the correctness of your programs. There
should be output files tracing the different parts of your implementation at
different debug levels.
